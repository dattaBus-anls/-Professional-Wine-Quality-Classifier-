# 🍷 Wine Quality Classifier (Streamlit App)

A professional Streamlit-based machine learning app that predicts the quality of wine (Poor, Average, Good) using physicochemical properties like acidity, sugar, sulfur dioxide, alcohol, and more. Trained on the combined red and white wine dataset from Kaggle.
